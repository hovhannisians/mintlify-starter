## Best Practices

### What Works Well
- Clear, descriptive language
- Specific details about style and mood
- Realistic expectations about AI capabilities
- Iterative refinement of requests

### What to Avoid
- Overly complex or contradictory descriptions
- Requests for copyrighted or trademarked content
- Extremely specific technical requirements
- Unrealistic expectations about quality

### Ethical Considerations
- Don't generate images that could be harmful or offensive
- Respect copyright and intellectual property
- Use generated images responsibly
- Consider the impact of AI-generated content

## Troubleshooting

### If Images Aren't What You Expected
- **Be more specific**: Add more details to your description
- **Try different styles**: Specify artistic style or approach
- **Break it down**: Describe elements separately
- **Iterate**: Ask for variations or refinements

### Getting Better Results
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Include style and mood specifications
- Be specific about composition and elements
- Ask for variations if the first result isn't quite right

### Common Issues
- **Vague descriptions**: "A nice picture" → "A serene landscape with mountains and a lake"
- **Missing context**: "A car" → "A red sports car on a winding mountain road"
- **Unclear style**: "A logo" → "A modern, minimalist logo for a tech company"
