4. Wait for Lexa to process the file
5. Ask questions about the file content

### Example Interactions
```
You: "Can you analyze this PDF report?"
Lexa: "I've analyzed your PDF. Here are the key points..."

You: "What's wrong with this code?"
Lexa: "I found several issues in your code. Here are the problems..."

You: "Explain this chart for me"
Lexa: "This chart shows the following trends..."
```
