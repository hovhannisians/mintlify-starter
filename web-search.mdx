## Web Search Feature

Lexa Chat's Web Search capability allows you to access current, real-time information from the internet. This feature ensures you get the most up-to-date answers to your questions.

## How Web Search Works

### Real-time Information Access
- Lexa searches the web for current information
- Gets the latest news, data, and facts
- Provides sources for the information shared
- Combines web data with AI analysis

### When to Use Web Search
- **Current Events**: "What's the latest news about AI developments?"
- **Live Data**: "What's the current stock price of Apple?"
- **Recent Information**: "What are the latest COVID-19 guidelines?"
- **Breaking News**: "What happened in the tech world today?"
- **Weather Updates**: "What's the weather like in New York right now?"

## Using Web Search

### Automatic Activation
- Web Search is automatically enabled in most conversations
- Lexa will search the web when you ask for current information
- You don't need to specify "search the web" - just ask your question

### Example Queries
```
✅ "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
✅ "Who won the recent election in [country]?"
✅ "What's the current price of Bitcoin?"
✅ "What are the top trending topics on social media?"
✅ "What's the latest research on climate change?"
```

### Getting Better Results
- **Be specific**: "What are the latest AI developments in 2024?" instead of "AI news"
- **Ask for current info**: "What's happening with..." or "What are the latest..."
- **Request recent data**: "What are the current statistics on..."
- **Ask for updates**: "What's the latest update on..."

## Limitations and Best Practices

### What Web Search Can Do

### What to Keep in Mind
- Information changes rapidly - always verify critical data
- Use multiple sources for important decisions

- Some information may be behind paywalls or require subscriptions

3. **Analysis**: "What are the implications of these developments?"
4. **Follow-up**: "What should I watch for in the coming months?"
